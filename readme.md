# Media Coverage of Refugee and Migration Policy in Australia, the UK, and the US

## Abstract

This research project aims to critically examine media coverage related to refugee and migration policy in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. With the global refugee crisis intensifying, media narratives play a crucial role in shaping public opinion and, by extension, policy decisions. Our research leverages advanced data analytics, particularly the [Newscatcher API](https://www.newscatcherapi.com/), to gather a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

## Research questions

The project is, to begin with, largely descriptive (we may refine this further as we gain data and explore the problem space further). Below are some of the categories of interest that we think Newscatcher will be very helpful for.

### International vs. domestic coverage

#### Questions
What proportion of media coverage on refugee and migration issues is international versus domestic in Australia, the UK, and the US? 

#### Significance
Understanding the geographical scope of media coverage informs us about the extent to which ordinary citizens are exposed to international debates on refugee issues. A predominantly domestic focus could mean limited exposure to global perspectives, potentially resulting in parochial public opinion.

### Nature of discourse

#### Questions
What types of arguments are prevalent in media narratives? These can include legal principles, sovereignty, the “will of the people,” morality, safety of citizens, and the safety of refugees.

#### Significance
Different types of arguments shape public opinion in distinct ways. For example, framing refugee policy as a matter of "sovereignty" could have implications for nationalist sentiments, while discussing it in terms of "safety of refugees" may elicit humanitarian responses.

### 3. Fine-grained categories of discourse

#### Questions
Is there a discernible pattern within each type of argument? For instance, within discussions framed around international law, what proportion criticize breaches versus advocate for changing the law itself?

#### Significance
Understanding the nuances within each argument type enables a deeper insight into the complexities of public opinion. Such an understanding is critical for policy formulation that aims to be responsive to a range of citizen views.

## Policy Implications

Understanding media narratives is foundational for shaping effective and humane refugee policies. This research aims to provide evidence-based insights that can inform policy decisions, ensuring they are attuned to the complexities of public opinion as shaped by media narratives.

## Why Newscatcher API?

The Newscatcher API is going to be uniquely valuable for this project for many reasons:
